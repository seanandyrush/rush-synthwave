# Rush Forest
Theme with forest-inspired colors. Focus more on the code. Matches well with languages.

Divided tokens into two classes of brightness: *Normal* and *Dimmed* to give more focus to the *Normal* code.

It is recommended to activate *Bracket Pair Colorization* and *Bracket Pair Guides* in the settings, and use *Error Lens* extension, when using the theme.

# Goals
